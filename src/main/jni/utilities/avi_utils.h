HAVI CreateAvi(const TCHAR *fn, int frameperiod, const WAVEFORMATEX *wfx);
// CreateAvi - call this to start the creation of the avi file.
// The period is the number of ms between each bitmap frame.
// The waveformat can be null if you're not going to add any audio,
// or if you're going to add audio from a file.

HRESULT AddAviFrame(HAVI avi, HBITMAP hbm);
HRESULT AddAviAudio(HAVI avi, void *dat, unsigned long numbytes);
// AddAviFrame - adds this bitmap to the avi file. hbm must point be a DIBSection.
// It is the callers responsibility to free the hbm.
// AddAviAudio - adds this junk of audio. The format of audio was as specified in the
// wfx parameter to CreateAVI. This fails if NULL was given.
// Both return S_OK if okay, otherwise one of the AVI errors.

HRESULT AddAviWav(HAVI avi, const TCHAR *wav, DWORD flags);
// AddAviWav - a convenient way to add an entire wave file to the avi.
// The wav file may be in in memory (in which case flags=SND_MEMORY)
// or a file on disk (in which case flags=SND_FILENAME).
// This function requires that either a null WAVEFORMATEX was passed to CreateAvi,
// or that the wave file now being added has the same format as was
// added earlier.

HRESULT SetAviVideoCompression(HAVI avi, HBITMAP hbm, AVICOMPRESSOPTIONS *opts, bool ShowDialog, HWND hparent);
// SetAviVideoCompression - allows compression of the video. If compression is desired,
// then this function must have been called before any bitmap frames had been added.
// The bitmap hbm must be a DIBSection (so that avi knows what format/size you're giving it),
// but won't actually be added to the movie.
// This function can display a dialog box to let the user choose compression. In this case,
// set ShowDialog to true and specify the parent window. If opts is non-NULL and its
// dwFlags property includes AVICOMPRESSF_VALID, then opts will be used to give initial
// values to the dialog. If opts is non-NULL then the chosen options will be placed in it.
// This function can also be used to choose a compression without a dialog box. In this
// case, set ShowDialog to false, and hparent is ignored, and the compression specified
// in 'opts' is used, and there's no need to call GotAviVideoCompression afterwards.

HRESULT CloseAvi(HAVI avi);
// CloseAvi - the avi must be closed with this message.

AVICOMPRESSOPTIONS *GetCompression();


unsigned int FormatAviMessage(HRESULT code, TCHAR *buf,unsigned int len);
// FormatAviMessage - given an error code, formats it as a string.
// It returns the length of the error message. If buf/len points
// to a real buffer, then it also writes as much as possible into there.
